Hello! I'm Ruoran Wang, this is my personal blog. I'm a graduate student major in Computer Engineering at University of Michigan. Besides a student, I am also a python web developer, and a sysadmin. I graduated from Illinois Institute of Technology, also major in Computer Engineering. In addition, I worked at [Promet Source](http://www.prometsource.com/) in DevOps team.

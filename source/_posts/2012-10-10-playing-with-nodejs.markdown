Recently I started to play with nodejs. Inspired by (cnodejs.org)[http://cnodejs.org], I created a forum called (A2UM)[http://a2um.com].
The forum is based on express, which seems to be very handy.

Here are the technologies that involved.

* CloudFlare for CDN.
* VPS provided by DigitalOcean.
* Forum source code from node_club

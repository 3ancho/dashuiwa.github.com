Born at the end of 1980s, fortunately, I have experienced the anonymous web.
Once, people can fake their names, hometown, and even gender. It was a time
that full of faked information, at a first glance. However, I remember the
forums and chat rooms are not full of non-sense info as nowadays. People used
to be graceful adventurers, but took arrows in the knees. Anyway, that web we
are used to familiar with is fading out. Dogs are kicked out of this Internet
game.

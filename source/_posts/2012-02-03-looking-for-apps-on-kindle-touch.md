title: Looking for apps on Kindle Touch

It is a great pleasure to read books on KT. However, I am always trying to
check my email and read reddit. Arguably, I understand it is not a device
designed for application. But I really believe it could have couple of useful
apps that helpful.

  1. Weather App There are already service let you push your google reader items to app. Why not send a weather report? To where? Maybe a corner of the screen saver.

  2. Email Client The gmail already works well on KT. A native app would boost up the experience. Maybe another corner of screen saver to indicate the new emails.

  3. Browser shortcut. (Or shortcut for applications, in other words navigation bar) Now it takes 3 taps to bring up the browser, which could be done by 1. Anyway, there could be a better UI.

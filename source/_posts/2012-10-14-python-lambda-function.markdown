This is the first episode of a series that revisits features that I didn't fully understand, about a technology such as Python, JavaScript, etc. The topic domain is, well, anything about computer science. (Really?) The purpose is, hmm, have fun. (Really?)

Ok, let's get started, Python Lambda Functions.

* So, it's anonymous functions, like `function() {}` in JavaScript, obviously.
* It's a feature inherited from functional programming, cool and confusing.
* Work well with filter(), map(), and reduce(). (all take a function and a sequence)

In summary, lambda in python, or possible in elsewhere, seems to be used to describe the individual affect of an AOE.
